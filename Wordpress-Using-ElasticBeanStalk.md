# Deploying a WordPress Website Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Step 1: Prepare WordPress Files

- Download the latest version of WordPress from the official website.
- Extract the WordPress files on your local machine.
- Customize the WordPress configuration files (e.g., wp-config.php) as needed.

## Step 2: Configure Database

- Set up a MySQL database for WordPress. You can use Amazon RDS for this purpose.
- Note down the database endpoint, username, password, and database name.

## Step 3: Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application

- Navigate to the AWS Management Console and go to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
- Click on "Create Application" and provide a name for your application.
- Choose "Web server environment" as the environment type.

## Step 4: Configure Environment

- Choose the platform as PHP and select the desired platform version.
- Configure additional options such as environment name, domain, instance type, and EC2 key pair.
- In the "Application code" section, upload the WordPress files prepared in Step 1.

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

- Go to the environment configuration and navigate to the "Software" section.
- Add environment variables for database connection (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME).
- Set the values of these variables to the database endpoint, username, password, and database name obtained in Step 2.

## Step 6: Review and Launch

- Review the configuration settings and ensure everything is set up correctly.
- Click on "Create environment" to launch your WordPress application on Elastic Beanstalk.

## Step 7: Monitor and Test

- Monitor the deployment progress in the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard.
- Once the deployment is complete, access your WordPress website using the provided URL.
- Complete the WordPress installation by following the on-screen instructions.
- Test the functionality of your website, including posting articles, uploading media, and installing plugins.

## Step 8: Additional Considerations

- Set up backups for your database to ensure data integrity and availability.
- Configure security settings such as HTTPS, firewall rules, and IAM roles to secure your WordPress environment.
- Monitor the performance and health of your Elastic Beanstalk environment using AWS CloudWatch.
- Regularly update WordPress core, themes, and plugins to maintain security and performance.
