# AWS Step Function: Create AMI, Terminate EC2, and Send SNS Notification

- Step Functions are a great way to orchestrate workflows where we have to integrate multiple AWS services together.

- In this example, step function is taking an AMI of the instance for backup before terminating and is sending a notfication email afterwards to inform about the result. 

## Step 1: Creat a Step function
   - AWS console provides a great visual canvas to create step functions. We can drag and drop components from left hand panel and create the workflow. Step functions integrate with most of the AWS services.
  
  - I have created the required workflow, which takes as input instance ID and image name.
