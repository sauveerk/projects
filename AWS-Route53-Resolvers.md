# Deploying Infrastructure on AWS

## Step 1: Deploy 2 VPCs

- Navigate to the AWS Management Console and go to the VPC service.
- Click on "Create VPC" and specify the details for your first VPC (e.g., CIDR block, VPC name).
- Repeat the process to create the second VPC with different CIDR block.
- Ensure that each VPC has its own unique CIDR block and a name for identification.

## Step 2: Deploy 2 EC2 Instances in the VPCs

- Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Management Console.
- Launch an EC2 instance and select the VPC you created in Step 1.
- Repeat the process to launch another EC2 instance in the second VPC.
- Choose the desired instance type, configure security groups, and allocate storage as needed.
- Ensure that each EC2 instance is launched in its respective VPC.

## Step 3: Create Inbound and Outbound Resolver Endpoints in Route 53

- Go to the Route 53 service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click on "Resolver" and then "Create Resolver."
- Specify the VPC ID and choose "Inbound Endpoint" to create an inbound resolver endpoint for the first VPC.
- Repeat the process to create an inbound resolver endpoint for the second VPC.
- Next, create outbound resolver endpoints for both VPCs by selecting "Outbound Endpoint."
- Configure the DNS resolution rules to allow each VPC to resolve the DNS names of the other VPC.

## Step 4: Test Connectivity Using EC2 Instances

- SSH into one of the EC2 instances deployed in the first VPC.
- Try to ping the private DNS name of an EC2 instance deployed in the second VPC to verify DNS resolution.
- Repeat the same process from an EC2 instance in the second VPC to an EC2 instance in the first VPC.
- Ensure that both instances can resolve each other's DNS names successfully.

## Step 5: Additional Considerations

- Implement appropriate security measures such as network ACLs, security groups, and IAM roles.
- Monitor the health and performance of your VPCs, EC2 instances, and Route 53 resolver endpoints using CloudWatch.
- Regularly review and update your infrastructure configurations based on changing requirements and best practices.
